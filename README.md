# sortingAlgorithms

 Coded a variety of different common sorting algorithms.  This project helped me develop a better understanding of how to implement fast sorting algorithms, and allowed me to compare each one which helped comprehend the vast differences in speed between them.  
 
Implemented sorting Algorithms:
• Insertion Sort
• Cocktail shaker sort (a variation of bubble sort)
• Randomized Quick Sort
• Optimized hybrid sort (that uses quicksort and insertion sort)
• External sort (that is able to sort a very large list stored in a file that does not fit into memory
all at once).
